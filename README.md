Data source: NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Datasets. GISTEMP Surface Temperature. deviations from the corresponding 1951-1980 means.

The GISTEMP analysis is updated regularly. Graphs and tables are posted on their website around the middle of every month using the latest GHCN v4 (meteorological stations) and ERSST v5 (ocean areas) data.

Using my spreadsheet skills, I deleted rows and columns to make the data smaller for my convenience. The smaller datasets are posted in this repository. 
The larger and updated versions of the three csv files can be downloaded through the links below:
